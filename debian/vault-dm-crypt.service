# This file controls which systemd services are automatically handled by debhelper
# Since all our services are either templates (@) or should be manually enabled,
# we leave this file empty to prevent any automatic enabling
#
# Services installed but NOT auto-enabled:
# - vault-dm-crypt-decrypt@.service (template, enabled per-device)
# - vault-dm-crypt-refresh.service (optional, manually enabled if needed)
# - vault-dm-crypt-refresh.timer (optional, manually enabled if needed)
